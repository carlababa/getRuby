# Get Ruby

A multi-player game with the objective to collect the largest possible amount of rubies. The game was developed from a pure javascript code and single player [see the original code](https://github.com/lostdecade/simple_canvas_game) and was refactored to be multiplayer using ReactJS, Socket.io and FeathersJS.
